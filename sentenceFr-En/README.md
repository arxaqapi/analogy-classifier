# analogical-sentences french-english translation

* Run the getData.sh shell script to get the dataset coming from the EU
* When unzip, you have 2 files containing 2 007 723 sentences each one.

* Run the python script generate_pair_Fr_En.py

At the end, we get a (big 1.2GB) csv file output.csv containing pairs (french_sentence,english_translation)
It is a serious dataset then but I am not sure we can manage this size.
